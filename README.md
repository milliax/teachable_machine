# Teachable Machine lesson IN AIGO

## Main Idea

Building a program that can control the electric door automatically with advanced sensor powered by Google Teachable Machine.

## Prerequisites

A mqtt broker (with two topic) </br>
A bridge (in this repository)</br>
An arduino with WiFi and serial port</br>
A computer with digital camera 

## Set up the mqtt broker
You can build the self-modified server using mosquitto.</br>

## Set up Arudino
upload the code to the arduino.<br>
the Radar simulation is to type in "D and N" in arduino serial port.<br><br>
D stands for detected things undert the sensor.<br>
N stands for nothing under the sersor. 

## Set up Laptop
Paste teachable machine to
[Online Teachable machine to mqtt](https://yisrealhung.github.io/tm2mqttdata/Index-image.html)<br>
Then type in the brokers you are using and bla bla bla
